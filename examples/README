These are some small examples that use Dotiac::DTL.

All of the examples use DBI for storage, so it has to be installed. 

You will also need a nice DBD module for this to work. 
(Modify the DataAccess.pm with your settings)
The default is DBD::CSV.

Since the Focus of Django and Dotiac is Web programming, these examples are all CGI-scripts. And I left out the user management, since it would be a lot of boring code.

Directories: (If you want to change them, change ConfigPathes.pm as well)

cgi-bin: the example-scripts, DataAccess.pm and ConfigPathes.pm
persistent: When using a local DBI module, the data is saved here.
templates: the templates. They shouldn't be in the same folder as the scripts, since that one is readable from the internet.
