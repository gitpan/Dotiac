21,1233062562,"This blog",Maluku,"This is a demo using Dotiac::DTL, a small and very simple blog.
It has no other functions, except:
View the blog (2 views)
Posting a blog entry
Adding a comment
Removing a comment

It is written in Perl + Dotiac-DTL and uses DBI for database interface. You can see the sourcecode in the blog.pl file.

It uses 2 tables to store its data:
blog_entry: An entry in this blog
blog_comments: The comments for each entry

There are 5 templates used here:
blog_base.html: This is the parent template all the other templates inherit from, it contains the design ( if you could call it that) of the page.
blog.html: The mainpage (overview) which shows all posts in pages
blog_view.html: The detail view, which shows one post and all the comments.
blog_new.html: Add a new post page
blog_error.html: An error-page which displays a message.

It also uses a global 'redirect' template to stop the browser from resending the data when the user refreshes the page.
